            <p>
                This is the week where we will be having meeting with our client, Mr.Ng from Obsnap Instruments Sdn Bhd, along with Mr.Brandon and Ms.Robina. We started off the meeting by introducing ourselves and then we proceed to Q&A section. Mr. Ng and Mr.Brandon then answered our questions and further explain about the projects. We also created a Whatsapp group as our communication platform with the clients.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 2 [30 March 2020 - 5 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                As we are having an internal meeting for the following week, I have done researches on what tools and steps to be taken to start our project. Besides, I also started to learn to use Bootstrap as it is suggested by the client due to the fact that Bootstrap provides a solution to help us design the website in a faster and easier manner.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 3 [6 April 2020 - 12 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                We had an internal meeting to discuss about the contents that are required for the first documentation, A1. After the discussion, members is assigned with tasks evenly. As we are going to develop a system, we have to start off by designing a wireframe first. Before design phase, we discussed on which wireframe tool to use for, and Figma is selected as our wireframe tool. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 4 [13 April 2020 - 19 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Nothing much happened for the week, members continue work on their assigned task. Besides, I have started to create a website for our team for future updates. A prototype of the website is created to show the team in the following week meeting. If the design prototype is agreed unanimously by the team, then I will start coding it.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 5 [20 April 2020 - 26 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                For this week, we had an internal checkpoint for the first documentation. The purpose of this meeting is to ensure everyone is on the right track. If any problem is encountered, problem can be solve as soon as possible. We discussed about the wireframe’s designs and functions, as there are a few doubt from our designer.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 6 [27 April 2020 - 3 May 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                As we are close to the deadline of the first documentation submission, we hosted a final checking session on each member’s work. Also, we also reviewed the first look of the wireframe. As the prototype design of the team website is approved by members in previous week, I have too completed developing the website.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 7 [4 May 2020 - 10 May 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                As we have prepared everything, there is nothing much to do for the week besides of continuing to learn the languages and framework required for the system, in example, Bootstrap. However, there is some minor changes we have made for the documentation, one of the team member came up with a better approach, hence, team decided to follow the idea.
            </p>
            <br/>

                This is week where we have meeting with our client again as it our checkpoint meeting. Our initial design and idea has been accepted and been approved by the client. However, there are changes has to be done, to make perfect of the system. Ms.Robina has pointed out our mistake and suggested ideas to the client and us, which we are not aware of, it’s been a great help to us, or else, it would be a disaster in the later phases. Our client also planned a meeting for the following week to provide information that are required to develop the system.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, as mentioned in the previous week, we had a meeting with client. The meeting has presented an adequate amount of information, hence, it cleared a lot of questions that I am uncertain about. However, it is a large amount of information, the client agreed to provide a few weeks for us to organize the information and make plans for it, to avoid us being overwhelm with stress.
            </p>
            <br/>

                No meeting has been held for the week. Everyone continue doing their assigned tasks. I also started learning the coding required for the latest changes/suggestion. By doing so, I can then demonstrate the feasibility of the suggestion/changes and members decides on what category of the requirement should fall on, whether it should be, mandatory, nice-to-have, or stretch requirement.
            </p>

However, due the back end language is different from what I have usually do, I have slow down my progression to take some time to learn. Luckily, there is no major different between the 2 languages, it is just a different way of writing.

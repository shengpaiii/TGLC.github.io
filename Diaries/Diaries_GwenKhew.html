            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 1 [23 March 2020 - 29 March 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Kick off meeting was conducted through Skype. The meeting started with self-introduction from us
and our client. We have proposed our team’s profile which includes respective member’s role and
personal insights. A presentation slide prepared by client was shared to us, regarding project
requirements and tools to be used throughout the implementation of the project. We have proposed
multiple questions to seek for client’s reply. It was a fruitful session as we got our queries answered.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 2 [30 March 2020 - 5 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Went through client requirements thoroughly. Research was conducted on how to achieve given
                requirements. I have tried out the websites given by the client to us as reference. Cheqroom is an
                equipment management application that helps to perform fast and secure equipment management.
                The features found in Cheqroom are very similar to our project requirements. I was able to visualize
                the look of our application and how the respective function works.
            </p>

            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 3 [6 April 2020 - 12 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Informal meeting was conducted through Discord with full attendance. One of the meeting agenda
was to discuss project group charter’s content. Ground rules and team goals were set and agreed by
all team members. Conducted discussion on A1 documentation content. Tasks to be done were listed
out and were segregated evenly to all members. Few wireframe tools were proposed in the meeting,
Adobe XD, sketch and Figma. We had our eyes on Figma as it is a web-based prototyping tool with real
time collaboration. It allows multiplayer collaboration and the interface can be shared to every single
member within a group. Final decision was made on which tool to use and Figma appeared to be the
one.

            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 4 [13 April 2020 - 19 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Meeting was held in the morning through Discord with full attendance. A1 documentation was
reviewed to check on everyone’s progress. Majority of the work has been done and everyone may
proceed to work on each remaining task. We have outlined the functions to be included in the
wireframe. I have never tried, don’t even know how to build a wireframe, but this time I would like to
give it a try.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 5 [20 April 2020 - 26 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                An informal meeting was held through Discord with full attendance. In the meeting, we had checked
on individual’s work progress before compilation. Minority of the tasks were left to be done 3 days
before the due. Later, we conducted discussion on the wireframe’s outlook and its functions. We have
gone through multiple websites found online to seek for wireframe’s design inspiration. Since I am
taking the lead in wireframe design and implementation, it is a must for me understand the operation
of the Figma application before taking real actions. Hence, I have scrolled through related websites
and viewed few Youtube videos covering Figma introduction and tutorial. As a beginner, I found it
difficult to use and it slowed down my working progress. After trying variations of layout and their
arrangement, I am getting familiar to it and eventually speeds up the design process. Feel good to
learn something new!
            </p>

            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 6 [27 April 2020 - 3 May 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                An informal meeting was held through Discord. We have checked on every member’s work before
compilation and submission. We have decided to attach two different schedules in the report, where
Gantt Chart is referring to the project’s progress while team’s timeline is referring to our group’s
working schedule. Since I have drafted a wireframe dashboard, it was shared via screen sharing to
everyone for feedback and comments. So far, my members are ok with the design, just that I have to
change some layout and icons. Further discussion has been made on wireframe functionality and
layout. I have conducted research on how to improve the wireframe’s look and feel.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 7 [4 May 2020 - 10 May 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                More research has been conducted on wireframe’s functionality design. It is important to prioritize
the mandatory functions and outline good to have functions in the wireframe. The wireframe design
will reflect on how our actual program will look like. My concern was on how to express the functions
in the wireframe. The main concept for wireframe design is to improve efficiency and accessibility. I
have tried to make the important functions interlink with each other, for example when the user
clicked on A to B, and to go to C, the page will redirect the user to C from B. The user does not haveto go back to the main page to do so. Basically, in this whole week, I have focused on wireframe design
and working towards its completion.

            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 8 [11 May 2020 - 17 May 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                The major event happening in this week was Checkpoint1 meeting. We have gone through wireframe,
project diagrams, project schedule and interactive Q&A session with our client and Ms. Robina. I took
up the role of wireframe presenter. I went through every single page of the wireframe and explained
on the functionalities that were included in it. I took quite a long time explaining it as the
functionalities were a lot. Then there goes the Q&A session where Ms Robina asked a few questions
on some specific functionalities and proposed ideas to us to improve it. Overall, I feel that the
presentation was quite ok, for me, I have to slow down my speech next time.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 9 [18 April 2020 - 24 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                We had meeting with our client and their employees. Glad to know Ms Aqilah, who works as engineer
in OBSNAP – she explained the process involved when they received maintenance requests from their
customer till the completion of the maintenance. My Internet connection was very bad on that day,
and I couldn’t even catch up with her on some parts. Luckily my leader recorded the whole meeting
thus I don’t have to worry too much. The meeting then proceeds to Jocelyn’s sharing, which is about
how their current inventory system works. Mr Shone pointed out what are the parts we should focus
on, and what he hoped to get from us. Overall, the meeting went quite smoothly, despite of my short
absence due to the poor internet connection.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 10 [25 April 2020 - 31 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Since I have missed out some parts in the previous meeting, I went through the recording all over
again. The maintenance process we proposed in the wireframe were very different from their actual
operation. Hence, I have gathered information regarding maintenance process as well as the points
pointed out by Ms Robina. Compiled every gathered detail for further research. Research has been
conducted throughout the week to understand the specific use of each function and to illustrate the
layout of the pages.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 11 [1 June 2020 - 7 June 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Continue to conduct research on gathered requirements. Meanwhile, the wireframe has been
modified according to newly added requirements. I have added extra features into reservation and
checkout process, aimed to simplify the processes, to improve efficiency as well as to gather user
feedback upon checkout. The existing maintenance process worked differently from the actual
operation, so I have proposed a sequential task execution format that explains the whole maintenance
operation in the wireframe. The concept of such design is to simplify the maintenance handling
process and allow new staffs to understand the whole process easily.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 12 [8 June 2020 - 14 June 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Continue to work on modification of wireframe. I have shared and explained the updated wireframe
to all my group members. They were fine with the latest wireframe design, the only part that I have
to change is to display the information in tabular format located in the dashboard. Final touch up has
been done to the wireframe few days before checkpoint 2. Practiced on the presentation flow one
day before checkpoint2.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 13 [15 June 2020 - 21 June 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Checkpoint 2 was held through Discord. Basically, in that meeting, we showed our progress to our
client – displayed the summary of system requirements, updated wireframe and initial webpage
design. For my part, I have gone through all the newly added functions in the wireframe. The client
did ask a few questions about the wireframe and got their queries answered. The meeting wasn’t too
long, but it went smoothly. For the remaining days, I focused on completing the documentations being
assigned to me.

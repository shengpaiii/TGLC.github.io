            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 1 [23 March 2020 - 29 March 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Kick off meeting was conducted through Skype. The meeting started with self-introduction from us
and our client. We have proposed our team’s profile which includes respective member’s role and
personal insights. A presentation slide prepared by client was shared to us, regarding project
requirements and tools to be used throughout the implementation of the project. We have proposed
multiple questions to seek for client’s reply. It was a fruitful session as we got our queries answered.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 2 [30 March 2020 - 5 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Went through client requirements thoroughly. Research was conducted on how to achieve given
                requirements. I have tried out the websites given by the client to us as reference. Cheqroom is an
                equipment management application that helps to perform fast and secure equipment management.
                The features found in Cheqroom are very similar to our project requirements. I was able to visualize
                the look of our application and how the respective function works.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 3 [6 April 2020 - 12 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Informal meeting was conducted through Discord with full attendance. One of the meeting agenda
was to discuss project group charter’s content. Ground rules and team goals were set and agreed by
all team members. Conducted discussion on A1 documentation content. Tasks to be done were listed
out and were segregated evenly to all members. Few wireframe tools were proposed in the meeting,
Adobe XD, sketch and Figma. We had our eyes on Figma as it is a web-based prototyping tool with real
time collaboration. It allows multiplayer collaboration and the interface can be shared to every single
member within a group. Final decision was made on which tool to use and Figma appeared to be the
one.
            </p>

            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 4 [13 April 2020 - 19 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Meeting was held in the morning through Discord with full attendance. A1 documentation was
reviewed to check on everyone’s progress. Majority of the work has been done and everyone may
proceed to work on each remaining task. We have outlined the functions to be included in the
wireframe. I have never tried, don’t even know how to build a wireframe, but this time I would like to
give it a try.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 5 [20 April 2020 - 26 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                An informal meeting was held through Discord with full attendance. In the meeting, we had checked
on individual’s work progress before compilation. Minority of the tasks were left to be done 3 days
before the due. Later, we conducted discussion on the wireframe’s outlook and its functions. We have
gone through multiple websites found online to seek for wireframe’s design inspiration. Since I am
taking the lead in wireframe design and implementation, it is a must for me understand the operation
of the Figma application before taking real actions. Hence, I have scrolled through related websites
and viewed few Youtube videos covering Figma introduction and tutorial. As a beginner, I found it
difficult to use and it slowed down my working progress. After trying variations of layout and their
arrangement, I am getting familiar to it and eventually speeds up the design process. Feel good to
learn something new!
            </p>

            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 6 [27 April 2020 - 3 May 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                An informal meeting was held through Discord. We have checked on every member’s work before
compilation and submission. We have decided to attach two different schedules in the report, where
Gantt Chart is referring to the project’s progress while team’s timeline is referring to our group’s
working schedule. Since I have drafted a wireframe dashboard, it was shared via screen sharing to
everyone for feedback and comments. So far, my members are ok with the design, just that I have to
change some layout and icons. Further discussion has been made on wireframe functionality and
layout. I have conducted research on how to improve the wireframe’s look and feel.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 7 [4 May 2020 - 10 May 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                More research has been conducted on wireframe’s functionality design. It is important to prioritize
the mandatory functions and outline good to have functions in the wireframe. The wireframe design
will reflect on how our actual program will look like. My concern was on how to express the functions
in the wireframe. The main concept for wireframe design is to improve efficiency and accessibility. I
have tried to make the important functions interlink with each other, for example when the user
clicked on A to B, and to go to C, the page will redirect the user to C from B. The user does not haveto go back to the main page to do so. Basically, in this whole week, I have focused on wireframe design
and working towards its completion.
            </p>

            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 8 [11 May 2020 - 17 May 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                The major event happening in this week was Checkpoint1 meeting. We have gone through wireframe,
project diagrams, project schedule and interactive Q&A session with our client and Ms. Robina. I took
up the role of wireframe presenter. I went through every single page of the wireframe and explained
on the functionalities that were included in it. I took quite a long time explaining it as the
functionalities were a lot. Then there goes the Q&A session where Ms Robina asked a few questions
on some specific functionalities and proposed ideas to us to improve it. Overall, I feel that the
presentation was quite ok, for me, I have to slow down my speech next time.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 9 [18 April 2020 - 24 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                We had meeting with our client and their employees. Glad to know Ms Aqilah, who works as engineer
in OBSNAP – she explained the process involved when they received maintenance requests from their
customer till the completion of the maintenance. My Internet connection was very bad on that day,
and I couldn’t even catch up with her on some parts. Luckily my leader recorded the whole meeting
thus I don’t have to worry too much. The meeting then proceeds to Jocelyn’s sharing, which is about
how their current inventory system works. Mr Shone pointed out what are the parts we should focus
on, and what he hoped to get from us. Overall, the meeting went quite smoothly, despite of my short
absence due to the poor internet connection.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 10 [25 April 2020 - 31 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Since I have missed out some parts in the previous meeting, I went through the recording all over
again. The maintenance process we proposed in the wireframe were very different from their actual
operation. Hence, I have gathered information regarding maintenance process as well as the points
pointed out by Ms Robina. Compiled every gathered detail for further research. Research has been
conducted throughout the week to understand the specific use of each function and to illustrate the
layout of the pages.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 11 [1 June 2020 - 7 June 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Continue to conduct research on gathered requirements. Meanwhile, the wireframe has been
modified according to newly added requirements. I have added extra features into reservation and
checkout process, aimed to simplify the processes, to improve efficiency as well as to gather user
feedback upon checkout. The existing maintenance process worked differently from the actual
operation, so I have proposed a sequential task execution format that explains the whole maintenance
operation in the wireframe. The concept of such design is to simplify the maintenance handling
process and allow new staffs to understand the whole process easily.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 12 [8 June 2020 - 14 June 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Continue to work on modification of wireframe. I have shared and explained the updated wireframe
to all my group members. They were fine with the latest wireframe design, the only part that I have
to change is to display the information in tabular format located in the dashboard. Final touch up has
been done to the wireframe few days before checkpoint 2. Practiced on the presentation flow one
day before checkpoint2.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 13 [15 June 2020 - 21 June 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Checkpoint 2 was held through Discord. Basically, in that meeting, we showed our progress to our
client – displayed the summary of system requirements, updated wireframe and initial webpage
design. For my part, I have gone through all the newly added functions in the wireframe. The client
did ask a few questions about the wireframe and got their queries answered. The meeting wasn’t too
long, but it went smoothly. For the remaining days, I focused on completing the documentations being
assigned to me.

            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>Sem Break</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Exam week and Sem Break. Our team continue to work on the project development while having our
short semester break. Our team had conducted group and self reflection to evaluate our team’s and
self-performance and to review our teams action plan. This is relatively important as it helps to work
more effectively since we are moving towards the development and deployment of the project. Before
moving to the next phase, I have gone through all the requirements and project specifications again
to refresh and pick up the parts that I might left out.

            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 1 [27 July 2020 - 2 August 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                An informal meeting was held through Discord. We have gone through the requirements and UI/UX
                of our system so that we are clear of what to do with the front-end programming. We are required to
                complete the assigned tasks within the given timeframe. I did some research on the languages
                required for front-end development. I am familiar with HTML as I have been using it for the past
                projects, but I have very little knowledge on bootstrap. I have gone through video tutorials and
                w3schools bootstrap tutorial to learn about it.

            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 2 [3 August 2020 - 9 August 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                Continued to work on front-end development. In the mid of development, I have injured my wrist and
I didn’t expect it to happen. I couldn’t perform like I used to be due to my current condition, and the
outcomes were below my expectation. To not affect our team schedule, I have informed my group
mates about my condition and tend to seek for a solution. Fortunately, our team’s progress is ahead
from the schedule, and I still have time to complete my work. Further research has been conducted
on jQuery components as we will be using it to visualize the data of respective modules.

            <p>
                Combination of front-end code. I have submitted my work to our lead programmer to combine the
codes. Meanwhile, we planned to have a site visit to demonstrate our work, to know more about the
company’s operation and workflow as well as to request for information and data that will be needed
for our database. Before we proceed to back-end programming, I did some research on the required
programming languages.

                Did some preparation work before the site visit. We have gone through the web interface together
which is the combination of individuals front-end programming work. We have discussed on the
structure, completeness and integration of the interface. Besides that, we have prepared a set of
questions for our client and hope to get the fields required to capture data so that we are able to
proceed to database design and back-end programming.

                Discussion about database. We discussed on the database structure. Since we have not received the
sample data from our client, we drafted the database with possible fields, and discussed on
relationship between classes as well as the unique field of the classes. I have prepared the first version
of the database, and later came out with the second version after we have received the sample data
provided by our client.

                Coding style is extremely personal and everyone of us has our own preferred coding styles. The
personal nature of coding style is a challenge in a team. It is important for our team to develop a
coding guide together to ensure that the coding style is being followed. It is better to include
comments in every single parts of the codes, so that it is easier to do integration, sidestepping thetedious process of understanding what the code does. Further updates have been done to the frontend codes to achieve uniform and eventually helps to reduce unnecessary problems we might face
while doing the back-end programming.

                Finalized front-end and started back-end programming. Cross-checking has been done to eliminate
possible errors and to ensure that we are on the right track before we proceed to back-end
development. Our system comprises of several modules, in which it supports different levels of user
access. We have divided the tasks based on different user levels; each person will take charge of the
modules related to that user. It will be easier for us to do code integration and deployment later.

                Continue to work on back-end development. I took some time to learn PHP PDO, as it is the required
back-end programming language. Although my progress was kind of slow when I started the back-end
coding, but soon I am able to grab the techniques and eventually speed up the coding process.
Meanwhile, I find it challenging when it comes to the analysis of programming algorithm.
Programming algorithm describes the exact steps needed to solve a problem or to reach a goal – and
I can’t afford to miss out any possible solutions that will affect the completeness of the system.
Mapping of programming algorithms may be time consuming, but it helps to reduce the ambiguity
and improve system’s efficiency.

                Continued working on back-end development. Made some changes to front-end to cater the backend coding to improve user experience. We defined majority of the fields on our own since we didn’t
receive much information from our client. Did some final touch up before submitting my work to our
lead programmer to combine all backend codes. We planned to have a site visit to client’s place to
demonstrate our current work progress, to finalize the fields that is required to be in the system and
to get feedback from our client.

                We had to cancel our site visit due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases and the session was
replaced with an online meeting. We did some preparation work before the online meeting. We have
gone through the compiled system, had an internal Q&A session, to make sure that everyone is clear
with our current progress. Also, we prepared a list of questions for our client to seek for clarification.
The meeting was conducted via discord, together with Mr Shone and Ms Aqilah. We presented our
work via screen sharing, went through every single module to make sure that we didn’t left out any
parts. Had a Q&A session with them and get our queries answered. An informal meeting was held on
the same day to recall the content of the meeting we had earlier and to discuss on how we can make
adjustment to our current system to cater our clients’ needs.

                An informal meeting was held to go through project tradeshow’s checklist. We have segregated the workloads among ourselves. I will be preparing our group’s poster for the tradeshow. Due to the time limitation for project pitch, all of us were given around 30 seconds for individual presentation. We have discussed on the project pitch’s presentation flow and what content to include in the video. I took the part where I must explain the problems faced by our client. Due to the time constraint, I have to shorten my speech to meet the time constraint, without losing impact. Prepared a presentation script beforehand to ensure that the important points are being highlighted so that the viewer can grasp the idea precisely.

                Video shooting for project pitch. Managed to explain the points I have prepared in the given time. Had another short meeting with my fellow group members to segregate the final documentation’s tasks. Since Ms.Robina expects to see new contents in the final documentation, we have thought of few ideas to present our document’s content. All of us agreed to present the content with Software Development Life Cycle methodology. We will describe the evolution of our system, from scratch to the final deployment of the system by following the series of phases clearly defined in SDLC. I would say it is the best framework that allows us to explain the process of developing a software.

                Continue to work on final documentation and tradeshow poster. Spent some time doing research to design a poster. Reviewed on existing poster design to identify and illustrate the important considerations for the poster content and layout. A poster conveys a message to the viewer. We hope to design a poster that allows the viewer to grasp the idea real quick with the few minutes time they spent viewing it. Customized the poster using Canva – the free online poster maker. Our poster design emphasizes on the key information that the viewer will need to know from our system.

                Had a meeting with our client and lecturer to demonstrate the complete system. Demonstrated the system with different user levels, went through and explained the functions and operations can be done in each module. In short, our client is satisfied with the presentation of the system but there are still minor parts to fix. Scheduled a meeting with our client for the final presentation before project handover.

            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 1 [23 March 2020 - 29 March 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                First week of our final year project, since we had already chosen the project about software for online monitoring and management system for factory and hospital equipment with IoT technology, before having the kick-off meeting with our clients Mr. Bernard Yong and Mr. Ng from Obsnap Instruments Sdn Bhd, we had already did some discussions about how we should do and what questions we needed to ask. During the kick-off meeting, they had explained to us more clearly about what we need to do and what are the objectives and goals of this project. Besides, we also asked them some questions we felt confused and not so understand during Q&A period. This meeting is helpful to us because after this meeting we had gotten the ideas about how the system will look like and also clear our doubts in some parts of the project. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 2 [30 March 2020 - 5 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                In this week, I had done some research about the IoT and learnt the tools that need to be used to do the project. We also had a group meeting to discuss about project topic. We finalized to mainly focus about the equipment management system part, and then secondary focus on IoT and Data Centre part. Besides, we had did our project workflow list (Gantt Chart). Based on the Gantt Chart we can know that in which time we need to process until where. If all the work can be done on time according to the Gantt Chart, then this project can be delivered to clients on time.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 3 [6 April 2020 - 12 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                We had an informal group meeting to discuss about the project group charter, A1 documentation tasks, and the tools used to do wireframe. We had discussed and set up our group’s rules and goals that agreed by every group member. After that, we had assigned the A1 documentation tasks to each group member to complete. The tasks are divided evenly to every member. Before end of meeting, a few wireframe tools such as Adobe XD, Sketch, Figma and etc. were suggested by group members. We had discussed each tool’s pros and cons and final decided to use Figma to be our wireframe tool.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 4 [13 April 2020 - 19 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                We continue did our assigned A1 documentation tasks. By using Microsoft Team, each group member had posted their tasks at there and kept updated every few days, so each group member could easily view the progress of each group member. While I was doing the tasks assigned to me such as Class Diagram, Use Case Diagram and etc, due to lack of information gathered from clients, the data needed to be recorded and the authority of each people in different position might not be fully designed correctly by us. We will need to have another meeting with clients to gather further information needed.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 5 [20 April 2020 - 26 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                In 23th April 2020, we had another informal group meeting to check each group member’s assigned A1 documentation tasks progression. The purpose of this meeting is to ensure each group member had done their tasks correctly and on time. If member faced problems while doing assigned A1 documentation tasks, we can discuss and solve the problem together during meeting time. Each group member can continue doing their tasks until 29th April 2020, one day earlier before due date to ensure there’s still have time to change when emergency problems occurs. We also discussed about the wireframe’s designs and functions such as what pages needed, what is the design in each page, and what are the functions in each page. We had gone through some other real-world website and looked through their page design to gather some ideas. Before end of meeting, we decided to have our checkpoint 1 (formal meeting with clients and Ms. Robina) in next week Thursday or Friday.
                <br/>
                To reserve a meeting date time with clients and Ms. Robina, first I had sent a formal meeting request to Ms. Robina to book a time she free to have meeting with us. But unfortunately, Ms. Robina told me that her schedule had fully been booked from next two weeks. So we need to discuss another meeting date time in our next group meeting.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 6 [27 April 2020 - 3 May 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                We had an informal group meeting to final checked the A1 documentation. We compiled all the assigned tasks into a word document file and posted in Microsoft Team. Each group member still can made changes to the compiled word document file until 29th April 2020 if they found some error needed to be change or edit. Besides, we had also reviewed the first draft of the wireframe designs. Majority of the pages needed, pages design and the functions needed that we discussed in our last group meeting had drawn by Gwen. Because of Ms. Robina’s schedule is fully been booked from this week to next week, so we decided to have another formal meeting date time on either 12th May 2020 Tuesday 4 – 5 pm or 13th May 2020 Wednesday 4 – 5 pm.
                <br/>
                I had submitted the A1 documentation file to Moodle on 30th April 2020.
                <br/>
                To reserve a meeting date time with clients and Ms. Robina, I had sent a formal meeting request to Ms. Robina again to book a time she free to have meeting with us. Ms Robina had agreed to have a meeting with us on 12th May 2020 Tuesday 4 – 5 pm. After Ms. Robina agreed, I had sent an official meeting invitation email to Mr. Bernard Yong to book a time to have a formal project meeting.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 7 [4 May 2020 - 10 May 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                We had an informal group meeting to discuss about A2 documentation. Because of A2 documentation was to prepare presentation slides, so we had also assigned the tasks to each group member. Each group member was focused on different part of A2 documentation and prepared their own presentation slides needed because they also need to present their assigned tasks during next week’s formal meeting (checkpoint 1) to clients and Ms. Robina. A compiled presentation Power Point file had been sent to Microsoft Team, each group member could directly add, delete and edit their slides in that presentation slides. Besides, the second draft of the wireframe had been shown to us. The wireframe was almost completed to be shown to clients next week meeting. Furthermore, our group’s website had been set up and finish designed by Sheng. We had started discussing about our website design and can start to record our personal diary and personal description to the website.
                <br/>
                Due to our client Mr. Bernard Yong had no reply to the meeting invitation email that I sent last week, so to ensure he did not miss my email, I had sent another meeting invitation email to him again. He had replied to my meeting invitation email in the following day and agreed to have a formal meeting on 12th May 2020 Tuesday 4 – 5 pm.
                <br/>
                In 7th May 2020, I had officially sent a formal meeting invitation email to our clients, Ms. Robina and all of my group member in order to book their calendar. After accepted to join the meeting, the system will book their calendar and record it.
                
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 8 [11 May 2020 - 17 May 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                We had our formal meeting (checkpoint 1) in Tuesday 4 – 5 pm. There was a small issue occurred before the meeting started which was one of our client Mr. Ng’s skype had problem to use (we supposed to use skype to do this meeting). They informed me 10 minutes before the meeting start, so at that moment I needed to quickly find another solution to handle this problem which was changed the meeting tool from skype to discord. I had communicated with Ms. Robina and all my group members that we needed to use discord to do this meeting. Luckily all of them had used discord and were willing to change the meeting tool to discord and the meeting could be started on time.
                <br/>
                The important things that we presented were the tools and development environment we wanted to use, wireframe, use case diagram, and UML diagram. All these could be considered as our prototype design draft and ideas of the system. Each group member had covered different parts during presentation, and I was presented use case diagram, UML diagram and our action plan. Our clients had asked few questions while we were presenting, luckily they accepted majority of our design and ideas. During the Q&A section, Ms. Robina had also suggested few ideas and functions that could improve the system to clients and us. For those ideas and functions that agreed and accepted by clients, we were willing to change or add it to our system in order to make the system become more perfect.
                <br/>
                After the meeting ended, I had sent our presentation slides to clients to review and also a UOW Short Form Confidentiality Agreement to them and wanted them took a look at it. If there was no issue, one of them needed to sign their signature and sent it back to me.
                <br/>
                The presentation slides (A2 documentation) together with UOW Short Form Confidentiality Agreement were submitted to Moodle on 13th May 2020.
                
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 9 [18 April 2020 - 24 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                We had an informal group meeting to discuss about the A3 documentation and the ideas and functions that discussed from last week meeting with clients. We discussed about how to link those ideas to our current designed system and also some stretch goals that we are willing to add into our system in future. Besides, we also set up some difficult ideas that could be added to our system, but time consuming, which considered as "nice to have" ideas. We will only add these "nice to have" ideas to our system if we had completed our system and still got extra time. About the A3 documentation, we had discussed and split the tasks evenly to each group member to do. Just like previous, each group member will need to update their progress in Microsoft Team every few days.
                <br/>
                In 21th May 2020, our clients had requested to do a meeting with us together with their employees. We agreed to have the meeting on the next day 2:30 pm. On the meeting day, one of their employees Ms. Syakilah had introduced to us their current service and repair workflow and the report format used. She wanted us to improve some part of the report format and also needed add in some additional functions to the system to both service and repair function and report format. After that, another employee Ms. Jocelyn had introduced to us some part of their accounting system. All the information shown were important because they wanted us to come out something similar to their system flow. We will try our best to fulfil all the require and produce a better system.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 10 [25 April 2020 - 31 April 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                We had an informal group meeting to discuss about all the information that gathered from last week’s meeting. We go through again the meeting record video and wrote down the important information from each slide. We discussed together about what functions that each section needed to ensure each of us will have the same concept and ideas. After everybody agreed with those concept and ideas that we discussed, we then tried to come out some sort of algorithm that about how our system will select employee to handle different task. Our current ideas were first select employee that had experience doing that particular task before; second, select employee who had least task assign, and so on.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 11 [1 June 2020 - 7 June 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                We had an informal group meeting to discuss about our next formal meeting date time (checkpoint 2) and grouping with another project group. We decided to have our second formal meeting date time on 17th June 2020 Wednesday 4 – 5 pm.
                <br/>
                To reserve a meeting date time with clients and Ms. Robina, I had sent a formal meeting request to Ms. Robina again to book a time she free to have meeting with us. Ms Robina had agreed to have a meeting with us on 17th June 2020 Wednesday 4 – 5 pm. After Ms. Robina agreed, I had sent an official meeting invitation email to Mr. Bernard Yong to book a time to have a formal project meeting. Mr. Bernard Yong had replied to my meeting invitation email in the few days after and agreed to have a formal meeting on 17th June 2020 Wednesday 4 – 5 pm. I had also officially sent a formal meeting invitation email to our clients, Ms. Robina and all of my group member in order to book their calendar. After accepted to join the meeting, the system will book their calendar and record it.
                <br/>
                The group that wanted to group with us was held a meeting through discord. We discussed about why they wanted to group with us and some other questions that relate to this problem. After the meeting, we decided to have a meeting with clients to confirm this problem in the following week.
                <br/>
                I had asked Ms. Syakilah a few questions that related to our project system few days ago and also requested to have those presentation files that she used in the previous meeting and some sample report files. She had answered my questions and sent those files to me before end of the week.
            </p>

            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 12 [8 June 2020 - 14 June 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                We had two informal meeting in this week, which were informal group meeting and informal meeting with clients and another group member. 
                <br/>
                During the informal group meeting, we had discussed about the presentation flow and also who will present which parts. Gwen had updated the wireframe design to latest version, which included those ideas and functions that suggested and agreed by clients in the last formal meeting (checkpoint 1). Moreover, Sheng had also show us the prototype of the webpage design. Both of them had done their task well and we were really for next week’s meeting.
                <br/>
                Another meeting with clients and another group had discussed about the grouping problem to clients. After went through some argument, clients agreed that both groups no need to combined, but needed to share system the information together because both system that did by us were similar, it just one was more related to inner side and one was more related to outer side of the completed system.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="agenda_title"><h3>WEEK 13 [15 June 2020 - 21 June 2020]</h3></div> 
            <p>
                We had our second formal meeting (checkpoint 2) in Wednesday 4 – 5pm. We had shown them the latest version of the wireframe, some requirement analysis about the functions in each different page and the authority of different type of user, and also the prototype design of the webpage. Because majority of the wireframe had been presented in the previous formal meeting, so in this meeting our group member Gwen was just only gone through those pages that had made changed. Our clients had approved our design. We also informed them that we will stop our project progress until here first in order to focus our final exam and will be continue doing this project after finishing our final exam. Clients understood our situation and agreed with that requirement.
                <br/>
                Ms. Robina was not able to join this meeting due to this meeting time collided with another UOW meeting time. I had sent our meeting record video to her to prove we had done our meeting successfully. Besides, this meeting record video was also sent to clients in order to let them view our design.
